The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) tutorials focus on issues of developer productivity, software sustainability, and reproducibility in scientific research software, particularly targeting high-performance computers.

We first presented a version of this tutorial in 2016, and since then we have been working continually to refine and expand it. We present it most often as part of conferences, but we are open to a wide range of venues, both in person (circumstances permitting) and online. Contact us for more information.

## Who should attend

Our tutorials can benefit people at any stage of their career, whether they are students, post-docs, or established practitioners. While the level of the content skews strongly towards beginner and intermediate levels, we have found that many established software developers may not be familiar with all of the ideas we present and appreciate learning about them. Managers of scientific software developers may find benefit in better understanding the experiences of their staff, and approaches to facilitate producing “better scientific software”.

## Schedule and format

Most tutorials take place as part of larger events, such as conferences. They vary in length from a couple of hours to a full day or longer, with topics and the level of detail chosen to suit the venue and fit the schedule. Our tutorials are mostly lecture-style. If time permits there may also be hands-on exercises.

## Registration

Most events require advance registration with the hosting venue and may require fee.

## Archives and history

A [separate website](https://bssw-tutorial.github.io/) provides the complete history of the BSSw tutorials. Each tutorial includes archives of the presentation materials. Some include videos as well.

Most of the BSSw tutorials have been presented under the auspices of the [IDEAS Productivity project](https://ideas-productivity.org/), which was, in some respects, a precursor to CASS. The IDEAS tutorial team contributed to the development of nearly all the materials we use today.

## Organizers

Recent BSSw tutorials have been organized and presented by a small team, under the auspices of the PESO, and RAPIDS projects, and initially, the COLABS project.
