# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" seperators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md (all lowercase)
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Please see the accompanying README.md for more detailed information and guidance.
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   areas:                  (list) REQUIRED Each product must be associated with at least one area; multiple areas should be listed as appropriate.
#                           Multiple areas should be listed in priority order -- the most relevant label, second most, etc.
#                           The recognized area labels are defined in `_data/sw-areas.yml`, and entries here must exactly match the `name` in that
#                           file, including both spelling and case.
#   cass_member:            (list) REQUIRED The names of the CASS member organizations (aka software stewardship
#                           organizations) you are associated with. Values include: "FASTMath", "PEOS", "RAPIDS", "S4PST", "STEP".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: COLABS, CORSA, SWAS)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A short description of your software.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#                           after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#                           description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#                           sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#                           should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).

description: High-performance linear algebra library for manycore systems, with a focus on sparse solution of linear systems
long_description: |
    Ginkgo is a modern C++ library focusing on efficient and portable solutions for sparse linear systems.
    It features backends for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs, as well as an OpenMP backend for CPUs, all 
    available from a common interface. Ginkgo includes advanced preconditioners like Incomplete Sparse 
    Approximate Inverse (ISAI) and the iterative factorization-based Parallel IC/ILU, as well as standard ILU(0)/IC(0); 
    it also has support for algebraic multigrid (AMG). Ginkgo 
    includes a variety of iterative solvers and batched iterative solvers. Ginkgo can be built with or without 
    MPI; most solvers support distributed matrices.
target_audience: |
    Anyone needing to solve large, sparse linear systems, particularly those wanting platform portability and GPU support.

# PACKAGING INFORMATION
#   This information is used to connect your product with its E4S and Spack packages, if available.
#   e4s_product:    (string) If your product is in E4S, list its e4S name here (may be different than `name`). If your
#                   product is not in E4S, comment out this entry.
#   spack_name:     (string) The name of your spack package(s), if available.  If you don't have a Spack package, comment out this
#                   entry. If your product has multiple Spack packages, list them using YAML list syntax:
#                   spack_name:
#                       - package1
#                       - package2
#                       - package3

# ADDITIONAL PRODUCT INFORMATION
#   These are OPTIONAL lists of resource links that you can provide to make your catalog entry more useful.
#   The typical set includes: Website, Repository, Downloads, and Documentation, but all of these are optional, and
#   you can also add other labels.   `additional_resource_links` is a general category; `end_user_resource_links` and
#   `developer_resource_links` are meant to target the named groups more specifically.  Use them as you like.
#
#   The essential inputs are structured as follows:
#     - label: Resource label           # REQUIRED
#       url: https://example.com        # REQUIRED
#       note: (additional info)         # OPTIONAL
#       icon: fa-solid fa-font-awesome # OPTIONAL, a FontAwesome icon identifier
#
#   Which would appear as (in pseudo-markdown):
#     {{ icon }} [{{ label }}]({{ url }}) {{ note }}
#
# For additional information, see _software/README.md.
