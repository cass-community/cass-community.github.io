#   description: A short description of your working group.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#   after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect, constructing a sentence-length 
#   description of the product with the form `name: description`.  However, it does not need to be a complete 
#   sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#   should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.

charter:
  purpose: |
    The CASS Software Ecosystem Working Group focuses on sustaining and improving collaboration across the CASS community and on promoting activities that support the scientific software ecosystem.  Our efforts include coordinating CASS birds-of-a-feather events, promoting a curated portfolio of independently developed, interoperable, and interchangeable libraries and tools that enable the development and use of application codes in the pursuit of scientific discovery, including in particular the curation of the E4S website.  We interpret the opportunities broadly to include community development, outreach, best practices in adopting and using the software portfolio, and more. Specific members include software coordinators from other product-owning software stewardship organizations.
  relationships: |
    The software ecosystem working group's efforts often align with those of the Software Integration, Impact Framework, and User-Developer Experience (UDX) working groups.
