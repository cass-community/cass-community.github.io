properly use GitHub Secrets for sensitive credentials:\r\n\r\n  * ${{ secrets.AZURE_CODE_SIGNING_NAME }}\r\n  * ${{ secrets.AZURE_CERT_PROFILE_NAME }}\r\n  * ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}\r\n  *

AWS-looking credential found (AKIAIMC3D3XLYXLN5COA) is in a test file:\r\n\r\n  * File: tools/libtest/h5tools_test_utils.c\r\n  * Purpose: \"unit-test functionality of the routines in tools/lib/h5tools_utils\"\r\n  * Context: \"real-world use case\" test case for tuple parsing\r\n  * This is test data for parsing AWS credential format, not an actual working credential\r\n\r\n**3 No

Various single-character test values (\"w\", \"c\", \"z\")\r\n\r\n** 5 .gitignore Does Not Exclude Credential Files**\r\n\r\nThe .gitignore doesn't exclude .env, .pem, or credential files, suggesting no such files exist or need to be excluded. The public repository does NOT leak valid private credentials. All sensitive credentials use GitHub Secrets, and AWS-format strings found are test data for parsing functionality. \r\n\r\nGitHub provides automatic secret scanning for public repositories, alerting maintainers when known credential patterns are detected.
