# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" seperators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Some keys are specifically chosen to match those in the e4s.yaml schema (ignoring case) 
#   with the expectation that they should have the same content (and probably will eventually be merged).
#
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   area:                   (string) REQUIRED The technical area of the product.  For now, we are using
#                           the areas that were used by ECP ST, except that anything that was categorized as
#                           NNSA Software under ECP should instead be listed under the appropriate "real" area:
#                           Values include: "dataviz", "devtools", "mathlibs", "pmr", "sweco".  
#   cass_member:            (string) REQUIRED The name of the CASS member organization (aka software stewardship
#                           organization) you are associated with. Values include: "fastmath", "peso", "rapids", "s4pst", "step".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: colabs, corsa, swas)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A one-sentence description of your software.  To be used as a
#                           "subtitle", following the `name`.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).
