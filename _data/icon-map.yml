# A "standard" mapping of resource labels to icons to use when displaying them,
# for use throughout the site (but especially in the software catalog)
#
# The icon entry should be an HTML reference to a FontAwesome icon of the
# form `<i class-"fa-something fa-else"></i>`

- label: Website
  icon: fa-solid fa-globe
- label: Repository
  icon: fa-solid fa-code
- label: Downloads
  icon: fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down
- label: Documentation
  icon: fa-regular fa-file-lines
- label: Area
  icon: <i class="fa-regular fa-folder-open"></i>

#
# Classes: End-user resources, Developer resources

# More additional ideas
#
# License (certificate or award or similar)
# Tutorial(s) (is this just Documentation?)
# Social channels (Maybe MM theme has many of these already? RSS, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TickTok, Bluesky, Mastadon, Facebook, YouTube channel, Slack, ...?)
# Relevant standards (???)
# Contributor guide
# Maintainer(s) (maybe not resource links, maybe internal to the md file rather than public?)
