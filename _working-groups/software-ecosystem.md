#   description: A short description of your working group.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#   after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#   description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#   sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#   should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.

  purpose: |
    The CASS Software Ecosystem Working Group focuses on sustaining and improving collaboration across CASS community, promoting activities in support of the scientific software ecosystem.  Our efforts include promoting a curated portfolio of independently-developed, interoperable, and interchangeable libraries and tools that enable the development and use of application codes in the pursuit of scientific discovery.  We interpret the opportunities broadly to include community development, outreach, best practices in adopting and using the software portfolio, and more.
