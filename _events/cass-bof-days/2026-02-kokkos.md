Join the Kokkos leads for a discussion on the state of the Kokkos Ecosystem and its future. This session will provide insights into the thinking of the Kokkos leadership on goals for the Kokkos community and how it will get there. This is in particular an opportunity for Kokkos community members who will be unable to join the HPSF Community Summit 2026 in Germany or the Kokkos User Group meeting at the HPSF Conference 2026 in Chicago to ask questions of the Kokkos leadership team and provide feedback on their needs with respect to future Kokkos development.
