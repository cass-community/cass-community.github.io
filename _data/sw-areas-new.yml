# These are the "areas" used in the software catalog
# They are derived from the areas used in ECP ST (https://www.exascaleproject.org/research/#software)
#
# The `name` should be in *sentence case*.  Software catalog entries must exactly match these names
#
# The `description` should be very terse, so that it fits reasonably in a sidebar
