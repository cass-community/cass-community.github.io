## The Science

WarpX is a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code that models the motion of charged particles or plasma.  WarpX is used to model chains of plasma-based particle accelerators for future high-energy physics colliders -- table-top particle accelerators.  These table-top accelerators can be used in both scientific and medical applications.

## The Enabling Software

WarpX relies on a wide range of scientific software to support its capabilities.  While much of the scientific software ecosystem was developed as part of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/) (ECP), the broader scientific software stack is well-represented.  

In order to support a rich ecosystem of GPU-capable scientific software, the Department of Energy Office of Science (SC) Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program funds a set of Software Stewardship Organizations (SSOs).  These SSOs have formed the Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS) as an umbrella organization to foster the stewardship and advancement of the current and future ecosystem of scientific computing software.  

The following highlights the use of CASS-affiliated software in WarpX.  

### AMReX

As part of the Exascale Computing Project, WarpX integrated AMReX, a software framework to support adaptive mesh refinement for large scale simulations, enabling high accuracy 3D simulations.  

Below: Simulation of laser wakefield acceleration performed with WarpX. The laser pulse propagates from left to right in a uniform plasma. A moving window is used, i.e. the simulation box travels at the speed of light to follow the laser pulse. The central slice of plasma electrons is shown as transparent white dots. A cavity free of plasma electrons forms in the laser wake, where an electron bunch (solid white dots) is accelerated. The colormap shows the longitudinal electric field in the wake. The white box in the center shows the mesh-refined area.  Image courtesy of Maxence Thévenet & the WarpX team.

### Spack

[Spack](https://spack.io/) is a package manager for that can be used on supercomputers, Linux, and macOS. It simplifies the installation of scientific software, managing the build dependencies and options.

### Paraview/Catalyst (in situ)

[ParaView](https://paraview.org/) is a commonly used open source post-processing visualization application. WarpX users can visualize, analyze and explore simulation data via ParaView.   The in situ API is [Catalyst](https://www.paraview.org/insitu/).  Catalyst can be integrated into a simulation code to run the visualization and analysis tasks while the simulation is running.

### Ascent

[Ascent](https://ascent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a lightweight in situ visualization framework.  Below: a pulse of elections (small yellowish blob) moves through the eclectic field in a laser-accelerated wake field from the WarpX simulation.

### VisIt

[VisIt](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/index.html) is another common visualization tool.  In the below image, a WarpX simulation is rendered on the OLCF Crusher machine (a precursor to Frontier).

### Viskores/VTK-m

ParaView, Ascent and VisIt all leverage the [VTK-m](https://m.vtk.org/) ([Viskores](https://github.com/Viskores/viskores)) visualization library.  

### ADIOS2

[ADIOS2](https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/v2.10.2/) is the current version of ADIOS, the Adaptable Input Output System.  ADIOS2 added OpenPMD and BP4 file formats to support WarpX I/O needs.  

### FASTMath Libraries and xSDK

xSDK, a [FASTMath](https://scidac5-fastmath.lbl.gov/) member, is a collection of related, complimentary, and interoperable math libraries.  The FASTMath libraries used by WarpX include [libEnsemble](https://libensemble.readthedocs.io/en/main/) (for parameter studies) and AMReX (for adaptive mesh refinement capabilities).  By linking in various math libraries via FASTMath’s xSDK, WarpX also can leverage such capabilities as BLAS++ and LAPACK++ and can readily incorporate additional math libraries when needed.

### MPI

WarpX allows multiple variants of MPI via Spack build flags.  OpenMPI and MPICH are part of the S4PST SSO.  

### Development Tools

The suite of development tools in the STEP SSO are designed to be used by scientific simulation codes for parallel high-performance application debugging and performance profiling.  These tools include Darshan, HPCToolkit, PAPI, TAU and Dyninst.
