# These are the "areas" used in the software catalog
# At present, they are the areas used in ECP ST (https://www.exascaleproject.org/research/#software)
#
# The `description` should be very terse, so that it fits reasonably in a sidebar
#
# If multiple entries have the same `name` they should have the same `description`.  Only the
# first occurrence should be used, but duplicatinag them is safer.

# Since it seems to be a common mistake, we'll accept `datavis` as well as `dataviz`
