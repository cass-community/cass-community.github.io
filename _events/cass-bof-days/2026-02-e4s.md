Modern HPC-AI applications rely on a large collection of software libraries and tools.  Bootstrapping a comprehensive collection of version-compatible products can be very challenging, especially for newcomers.  In this BoF, we briefly show how, in a few steps, a new user can obtain, launch, and execute their first HPC-AI application using containers from the E4S project.  After introducing the steps, we will take questions and support attendees toward successfully running their first program.
