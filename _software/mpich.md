# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" seperators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Some keys are specifically chosen to match those in the e4s.yaml schema (ignoring case) 
#   with the expectation that they should have the same content (and probably will eventually be merged).
#
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   areas:                  (list) REQUIRED Each product must be associated with at least one area; multiple areas should be listed as appropriate.
#                           Multiple areas should be listed in priority order -- the most relevant label, second most, etc.
#                           The recognized area labels are defined in `_data/sw-areas-new.yml`, and entries here must exactly match the `name` in that
#                           file, including both spelling and case.
#   cass_member:            (list) REQUIRED The names of the CASS member organizations (aka software stewardship
#                           organizations) you are associated with. Values include: "fastmath", "PESO", "RAPIDS", "S4PST", "STEP".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: colabs, corsa, swas)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A one-sentence description of your software.  To be used as a
#                           "subtitle", following the `name`.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).

description: A high performance open-source implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
long_description: |
    MPICH is a widely used, open­-source implementation of the MPI
    message passing standard. It has been ported to many platforms and
    used by major HPC vendors and research groups as the basis for their
    own MPI implementations. MPICH addresses many challenges in scaling
    up to large supercomputers, including performance and memory usage,
    to ensure the MPI standard is efficiently implemented on new
    hardware including GPUs and accelerators.
target_audience: |
    The scientist relies on Message Passing Interface (MPI) to create
    portable software. MPICH and MPICH-derived vendor MPI libraries
    offers the best performance and scalability on some of the largest
    supercomputers today. It allows scientists and developers to write
    their applications once, and move them to different HPC systems with
    good performance.

# PACKAGING INFORMATION
#   This information is used to connect your product with its E4S and Spack packages, if available.  It is only
#   needed under certain conditions:
#   e4s_product:    (string) Needed if the E4S name for your product is different than your preferred `name` of the product.
#                   If your product is not in E4S, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#   spack_name:     (string) Needed if the Spack package name differs from the `e4s_product` name.
#                   If your product does not have a Spack package, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#
e4s_product: mpich
spack_name: mpich
#
# ADDITIONAL PRODUCT INFORMATION
#   This is an OPTIONAL list of resource links that you can provide to make your catalog entry more useful.
#   The typical set includes: Website, Repository, Downloads, and Documentation, but all of these are optional, and
#   you can also add other labels.
#
#   The essential inputs are structured as follows:
#     - label: Resource label           # REQUIRED
#       url: https://example.com        # REQUIRED
#       note: (additional info)         # OPTIONAL
#       icon: fa-solid fa-font-awesome # OPTIONAL, a FontAwesome icon identifier
#
#   Which would appear as (in pseudo-markdown):
#     {{ icon }} [{{ label }}]({{ url }}) {{ note }}
#
# For additional information, see _software/README.md.
