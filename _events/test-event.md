#     github-id: mikeb650
#     bio: "Mike Bernhardt started the Bernhardt Agency in 1994, focused on
# helping companies in the HPC market segment. After less than a year of
# running the agency from an office in downtown Portland, and dealing
# with the frustration of parking, commuter traffic, and the rising cost
# of office space, he decided to take the company virtual.  He ran this
# agency, and two subsequent agencies as virtual organizations for 19
# years, eventually employing more than 25 full-time employees working
# from their homes offering communications services to companies
# throughout the HPC ecosystem in North America.  In 2001, 2002, and
# 2003, his [virtual] agency was named the top marketing agency to work
# for by Oregon Business magazine, and in 2003 it took top honors as the
# #1 small business to work for in Oregon.  Mike currently leads
# communications and outreach for ECP."

[Code-review.org](https://code-review.org) is an online tutorial for code review made possible by the [Better Scientific Software Fellowship](https://bssw.io/fellowship). Code review is a skill. You can break it down, you can practice, and you can get better at it. The difficulty is you are often learning a bunch of other skills at the same time. Scientists are often working on a new scientific problem while trying to learn git, GitHub, a programming language, etc., all while someone ‘criticizes’ their code. In addition, scientific software developers may start work in a new and unfamiliar domain. It can be very difficult to separate criticism of the code from criticism of the person. Reviewing is hard; people truly need to take into account how to communicate constructive and actionable criticism. [Code-review.org](https://code-review.org) aims to provide a way to practice reviewing in a no-consequence environment using the tutorial. Experience with code review from the NCAR Software Engineering Assembly will be presented, including the positive and negative effects of code review.
