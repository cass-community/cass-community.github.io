  purpose: |
    The purpose of the Impact Framework Working Group (WG) is to develop and refine the CASS Impact Framework process, and advise on and curate its use across the consortium. The CASS Impact Framework (IF) process is intended to provide a uniform, but flexible approach to gathering information to help the CASS member organizations understand the status and progress made by supported software projects with respect to the quality and sustainability of the software, and the impact those and other improvements have had on the usage of the software and on its ability to support scientific discovery.
  relationships: |
    We will collaborate with the [Metrics](metrics) WG to identify or develop, implement, and analyze appropriate metrics to support the needs of the IF process.
  lifetime: Standing.  We plan a process of review and refinement each time the IF is used.
