#   description: A short description of your working group.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#   after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#   description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#   sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#   should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.

    The goal of the CASS Workforce Working Group is to advance multidisciplinary leadership in next-generation computing sciences, with emphasis on robust and innovative scientific software as a cornerstone of advancing basic science, innovation, and security.
    
    Based on the current membership of CASS, our mission is:
   
    - Establish a sustainable plan to recruit and retain a vibrant workforce in the DOE HPC/AI community by fostering a supportive culture for all.
    - Engage talented people (with emphasis on students at colleges and universities throughout the U.S.) with the potential for strong skills and interest in HPC/AI.
    - Raise awareness of DOE activities and needs related to scientific applications, software technologies, hardware, and infrastructure.
    - Provide pathways for interactions, including training, internships, collaborations, and seamless entry into HPC/scientific software careers.
    - Leverage and complement existing outreach efforts DOE national laboratories, computing facilities, and the HPC computational science community.
