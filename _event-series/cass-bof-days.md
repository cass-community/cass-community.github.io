title: CASS BoF Days
series: "CASS BoF Days"

CASS BoF Days provides opportunities to bring communities together for Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions around topics of interest.

## Who should attend

BoF Days sessions cover a variety of topics. Attend any and all of interest to you!

## Schedule and format

The BoFs take place over several days, usually with multiple time slots each day, and sometimes with multiple BoFs taking place in each time slot (in order to accommodate all the requests). Each session is usually either 60 or 90 minutes. We generally organize CASS BoF Days at least once a year.

## Registration

Participation is free and open to the public, however, registration is required for each event.

## Organize something with us!

If you’d like to work with us to organize a BoF, please feel free to reach out to the [member representatives](https://cass.community/about/#current-members-and-leadership) related to your technical interests, or email us at <mailto:{{ site.email }}>.
