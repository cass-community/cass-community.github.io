The Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS, https://cass.community) has recently been established to pursue the stewardship and advancement of the current and future ecosystem of scientific computing software. CASS member organizations participate in CASS Working Groups, which focus on critical issues that crosscut the scientific software ecosystem to help create a more sustainable future for scientific and research software. This minisymposium will highlight the early efforts and goals of five CASS Working Groups (WGs): Integration, Workforce, User Developer eXperience (UDX), Impact Framework, and Metrics WGs. The Integration WG looks for ways to advance the integration of the ecosystem and its components with user communities, E4S, and Spack while increasing efficiency by transitioning activities such as CI testing to higher levels within the ecosystem. The Workforce WG fosters and stewards the workforce community by cultivating broad pathways to sustainable HPC & AI careers. The UDX WG focuses on better understanding and improving the experiences of both users and developers. The Impact Framework and Metrics WGs work closely together to gather information from software products to better understand teams’ process, progress, and impact, with a focus on showcasing achievements, not comparison among software products. CASS is seeking a broad coalition of stakeholders to participate in achieving meaningful outcomes through its working groups.
