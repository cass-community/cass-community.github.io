CASS operates on the voluntary contributions of effort and resources by its member organizations and others in the community.  Working groups are the primary means by which we organize members of the CASS community to get things done.  Below, you'll find both logistical information about the various CASS working groups, as well as outputs they are sharing with the public.

Most CASS working groups welcome public participation (i.e., you don't have to be part of a CASS member organization), so if you want to see what we're doing, or help out, please join us!  Though our work is quite open, for security reasons, we don't provide all of the details of the collaboration tools we use here.  Please contact the working group chair to get connected.
