name: # Name of the WG, without "WG" or "Working Group" at the end

#   description: A short description of your working group.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#   after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#   description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#   sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#   should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.

purpose: |
  The goals of the CASS Integration Working Group are to improve quality, sustainability, delivery, and interoperability across the scientific and AI software ecosystem. Individual efforts take place at the ecosystem and individual product community levels, including on-node and inter-node programming systems, tools, data and visualization, math libraries, and workflows.  The dual focus on ecosystem and product levels is essential due to the challenges of creating a cohesive ecosystem that includes product communities with different needs and varying levels of maturity.
relationships: |
  Integration working group efforts are often synergistic with the Impact Framework and User-Developer Experience (UDX) working groups.
