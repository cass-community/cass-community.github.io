description: chipStar is a tool for compiling and running HIP/CUDA on SPIR-V via OpenCL or Level Zero APIs.
long_description: |
    chipStar enables compiling and running HIP and CUDA
    applications on platforms which support SPIR-V as the
    device intermediate representation. It supports OpenCL
    and Level Zero as the low-level runtime alternatives.
target_audience: |
    chipStar is intended to be used by application and
    runtime developers that already target HIP or CUDA and
    want to target a platform that supports OpenCL or
    Level-Zero, such as Intel GPUs.
