  *Purpose:*
  The Metrics Working Group facilitates a coordinated effort to curate and develop metrics for understanding software sustainability, quality and impact from the perspective of scientific and research software. We will  leverage  research-backed analysis tools that will enable projects to collect and interpret these metrics for the long-term benefit of their software development efforts. Our goals are to:
	-Identify and define metrics that are meaningful for understandingsoftware sustainability, quality and impact.
	-Align metrics with the preferences and requirements of foundations, grant-making bodies, and other stakeholders.
	-Identify and deploy tools for collecting and analyzing these metrics 
	-Engage directly with software projects to understand and support their specific needs with respect to relevant metrics.

  *Relationship to other working groups:* We will work collaboratively with the Impact Framework WG and support their efforts in evaluating and reporting the outcomes of software projects through the use of metrics. Additionally, the Metrics WG will work with other relevant WGs and stakeholders to ensure broad utility and alignment of its outputs.

  *Lifetime:* Standing.  The WG will periodically refine its metrics and set of tools as the needs of the community evolve. 

  *Membership:* Open

  *Reporting:* Quarterly

# Give people an idea of the resources we're using for collaboration.

# For security reasons, we don't actually share the links.  Is this
# useful?  Maybe the only thing potentially useful here is the
# meeting information -- so people know what to expect?  If that's the only thing
# maybe we should just have a dedicated field for meeting info?

This space can be used to present whatever additional content the WG wants to provide.  If there's a *lot* of material, we can add separate sections to the website and link over to them.  But I suspect that in most cases, they'll want to provide brief updates, and maybe link to documents, events, etc., none of which needs to take up an enormous amount of space.

We held a mini-workshop on Effective Metrics for Measuring and Enhancing Sustainability in Scientific Software held at the Sustainable Scientific Software Conference (S3C) 2024.
