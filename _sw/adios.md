# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" separators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Some keys are specifically chosen to match those in the e4s.yaml schema (ignoring case) 
#   with the expectation that they should have the same content (and probably will eventually be merged).
#
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   area:                   (string) REQUIRED The technical area of the product.  For now, we are using
#                           the areas that were used by ECP ST, except that anything that was categorized as
#                           NNSA Software under ECP should instead be listed under the appropriate "real" area:
#                           Values include: "dataviz", "devtools", "mathlibs", "pmr", "sweco".  
#   cass_member:            (string) REQUIRED The name of the CASS member organization (aka software stewardship
#                           organization) you are associated with. Values include: "fastmath", "peso", "rapids", "s4pst", "step".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: colabs, corsa, swas)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A one-sentence description of your software.  To be used as a
#                           "subtitle", following the `name`.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).

name: ADIOS
area: datavis
cass_member: rapids
description: ADIOS provides a simple, flexible way for scientists to describe the data in their code that may need to be written, read, or processed
long_description: |
    The Adaptable IO System (ADIOS) provides a simple, flexible way for scientists to describe 
    the data in their code that may need to be written, read, or processed outside of the 
    running simulation. By providing an external to the code XML file describing the various 
    elements, their types, and how you wish to process them this run, the routines in the host code 
    (either Fortran or C) can transparently change how they process the data.
target_audience: |
    ADIOS is widely used in the fusion energy sciences, as well as in the high energy physics and environmental research communities. Science teams interested in a convenient parallel interface for storing and retrieving structured data, as well as passing data between codes, should consider ADIOS.

# PACKAGING INFORMATION
#   This information is used to connect your product with its E4S and Spack packages, if available.  It is only
#   needed under certain conditions:
#   e4s_product:    (string) Needed if the E4S name for your product is different than your preferred `name` of the product.
#                   If your product is not in E4S, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#   spack_name:     (string) Needed if the Spack package name differs from the `e4s_product` name.
#                   If your product does not have a Spack package, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#
e4s_product: ADIOS2
spack_name: adios2
