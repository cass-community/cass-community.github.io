# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" seperators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Some keys are specifically chosen to match those in the e4s.yaml schema (ignoring case) 
#   with the expectation that they should have the same content (and probably will eventually be merged).
#
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   area:                   (string) REQUIRED The technical area of the product.  For now, we are using
#                           the areas that were used by ECP ST, except that anything that was categorized as
#                           NNSA Software under ECP should instead be listed under the appropriate "real" area:
#                           Values include: "dataviz", "devtools", "mathlibs", "pmr", "sweco".  
#   cass_member:            (string) REQUIRED The name of the CASS member organization (aka software stewardship
#                           organization) you are associated with. Values include: "fastmath", "peso", "rapids", "s4pst", "step".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: colabs, corsa, swas)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A one-sentence description of your software.  To be used as a
#                           "subtitle", following the `name`.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).

name: Legion
area: pmr
cass_member: s4pst
description: A task-based programming model and runtime.
long_description: |
    Legion is an implicitly parallel task-based programming model and runtime.  The key features of Legion are: implicit
    parallelism (users do not to schedule computations and data movement), a flexible sublanguage for data partitioning
    (allowing simple expression of complex communication patterns), and separation of the expression of the computation
    from how it is mapped into the machine.  Together, these features make it more productive to modify existing code
    (to add or remove computations), to port programs to new machines (which generally requires only writing a new mapping),
    and reasoning about correctness. Legion is also designed to be compositional, and a growing set of Legion libraries
    provide support for accelerating Python, deep learning, data analysis, and simulation.
  
target_audience: |
    Developers of scientific and data analysis codes, particularly people who desire a higher-level interface to programming supercomputers
    than traditional bulk-synchronous models.

# PACKAGING INFORMATION
#   This information is used to connect your product with its E4S and Spack packages, if available.  It is only
#   needed under certain conditions:
#   e4s_product:    (string) Needed if the E4S name for your product is different than your preferred `name` of the product.
#                   If your product is not in E4S, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#   spack_name:     (string) Needed if the Spack package name differs from the `e4s_product` name.
#                   If your product does not have a Spack package, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#

#spack_name:

# ADDITIONAL PRODUCT INFORMATION
#   These OPTIONAL keys will allow your catalog entry to link to further information that visitors may find useful
#
#   repository:     (URL) Public repository for the product
#   source:         (URL) Public source code download for the product
