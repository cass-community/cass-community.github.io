The purpose of the CASS Vendor Forum is to promote engagement and communication between the Consortium and the commercial vendors that provide products (hardware, software, or services) in support of scientific computing. The Vendor Forum is meant to be broadly inclusive so that all interested parties may participate.

The [software in the CASS portfolio](https://cass.community/software/) enables a wide range of scientific computing in HPC environments, and historically, vendors have incorporated some of these software packages into their own products. Additionally, many of the software teams in CASS are interested in pursuing codesign activities, and the Vendor Forum will help facilitate connections between vendors and consortium teams for this purpose.

## Benefits of participation

The CASS Vendor Forum is a conduit for the exchange of information and experiences between the Consortium and commercial organizations. It will facilitate collaboration and advance technology awareness to enhance computational capabilities for the field as a whole.

Participants in the CASS Vendor Forum will be kept apprised of the latest activities, concerns, and trends from a broad cross section of the scientific software community and will have an opportunity to provide feedback and engage in areas of interest.

Vendor Forum participants will be able to follow up with CASS (outside of briefing events) for the following purposes:

* To provide feedback on overall CASS activities  
* To request more detailed follow up discussions on topics of interest  
* To engage with CASS members to explore potential codesign activities

## Vendor Forum expectations

Any vendor of hardware, software, or services in support of scientific computing is encouraged to join and participate in the CASS Vendor Forum. We solicit participation from representatives with technical expertise and interest in scientific computing rather than those with marketing interests.

Interested parties may join the forum by signing up for the CASS Vendor Forum announce-only mailing list. Upcoming engagement opportunities, briefings, and updates will be communicated via the mailing list. CASS will present briefings at a regular cadence.
