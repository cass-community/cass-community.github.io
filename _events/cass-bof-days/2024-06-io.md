We are in an exciting time for storage and I/O.  While traditional simulation I/O still has high demands for bulk synchronous reads and writes, I/O libraries must also help AI and workflow workloads.  Accelerators dominate HPC architectures, and new networks are coming online.

In SciDAC RAPIDS we have developers from the ROMIO MPI-IO implementation, the ADIOS framework, and the HDF5 and Parallel-NetCDF high-level I/O libraries.  We also have tools for understanding I/O in Darshan and TAU.  In this community discussion, we will cover some of the most pressing challenges faced by storage tools and libraries.  We also hope the community will share their own concerns.
