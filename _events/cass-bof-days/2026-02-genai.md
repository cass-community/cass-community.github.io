Generative AI Tools enable promising new workflows that can dramatically improve the effectiveness and efficiency of software efforts, throughout the software product lifecycle.  In this BOF, we provide a forum for those who are interested in sharing and learning about some of the approaches that work and don’t work well.  We present a few starting ideas and then open the conversation for all participants to share and learn.
