    CHANGES FROM EV-COLLECTION LAYOUT
    * This layout should exactly follow the ev-collection.html layout, EXCEPT
    * We need to fix the collection to be `events` in the body.
      - Unfortunately, the `page.collection` variable gets set to `event-series`
        and I've found no way to override it (frontmatter settings of `collection`
        are ignored.)
