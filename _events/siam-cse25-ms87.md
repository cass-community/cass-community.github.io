At the conclusion of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project (ECP) in 2023, the DOE Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) funded “seedling” projects to conceptualize the future of scientific software stewardship. Under the banner of Next-Generation Scientific Software Technologies, each seedling project has come together to have a voice and a role in the future of scientific software. The Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS, <https://cass.community>) facilitates collaboration and coordination among the projects to ensure the collective broad and consistent support for stewardship. In this minisymposium we introduce CASS through the lens of each seedling project, providing details about ongoing collective and individual efforts to ensure the success of the scientific software ecosystem, including 1) the scope and charters of member software stewardship organizations, 2) the software stewardship portfolio of math libraries, data and visualization packages, programming environments, performance and correctness tools, and workflow building blocks available within the DOE/ASCR scientific software ecosystem, and 3) how you can get involved in CASS, leverage the support of foundations, and more. Key take-aways of this session are increasing awareness of stewardship opportunities, identifying a community acting in the interest of the ecosystem, and discovering new efforts to advance the scientific software ecosystem.
