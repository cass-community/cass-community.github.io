MPICH is a widely used, open-­source implementation of the MPI message passing standard. It has been ported to many platforms and used by several vendors and research groups as the basis for their own MPI implementations. This BoF session will provide a forum for users of MPICH as well as developers of MPI implementations derived from MPICH to discuss experiences and issues in using and porting MPICH. Future plans for MPICH will be discussed. MPICH developers will also be present for an open forum discussion.
