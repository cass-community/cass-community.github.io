title: Technical Sessions and Meetings
series: "Technical Sessions and Meetings"
---
CASS members and affiliates collaborate widely to organize sessions at larger meetings as well as standalone events. Often, these events are intended to create opportunities to talk about software stewardship, development, productivity, and related topics. These may take the form of technical sessions or informal “birds-of-a-feather” (BoF) sessions within larger conferences, or standalone workshops.

## Who should attend

Our technical sessions are organized around topics chosen to suit the hosting venue and are likely to be of interest to anyone who is anyone who is involved in or cares about the development and use of scientific software.

## Registration

Most events require advance registration with the hosting venue and may require a fee.

## Organize something with us!

If you’d like to work with us to organize something, please feel free to reach out to the [member representatives](https://cass.community/about/#current-members-and-leadership) related to your technical interests, or email us at <mailto:{{ site.email }}>.

## Related resources

For most of the technical sessions we (co-)organized, we try to create something archival, most often a collection of the presentation slides. Such artifacts will be included in the individual event pages, linked below.

Since 2016, we've organized a BoF on software engineering for computational science and engineering on high-performance computers at the Supercomputing conferences and sometimes at ISC. Recent episodes, organized under the auspices of CASS, are listed below, but a complete archive of the BoF series is available at <http://bit.ly/swe-cse-bof>.

Prior to 2024, the [IDEAS Productivity project](https://ideas-productivity.org/) organized numerous technical sessions in a similar vein. They are archived at <https://ideas-productivity.org/resources/series/technical-sessions-and-meetings/>.
