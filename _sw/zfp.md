# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" separators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Some keys are specifically chosen to match those in the e4s.yaml schema (ignoring case) 
#   with the expectation that they should have the same content (and probably will eventually be merged).
#
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   area:                   (string) REQUIRED The technical area of the product.  For now, we are using
#                           the areas that were used by ECP ST, except that anything that was categorized as
#                           NNSA Software under ECP should instead be listed under the appropriate "real" area:
#                           Values include: "dataviz", "devtools", "mathlibs", "pmr", "sweco".  
#   cass_member:            (string) REQUIRED The name of the CASS member organization (aka software stewardship
#                           organization) you are associated with. Values include: "fastmath", "peso", "rapids", "s4pst", "step".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: colabs, corsa, swas)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A one-sentence description of your software.  To be used as a
#                           "subtitle", following the `name`.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).

name: zfp
area: dataviz
cass_member: rapids
description: zfp is an open-source library for compressed floating-point and integer arrays that support high throughput read and write random access
long_description: |
    One of zfp's unique features is its support for efficient in-memory representation of 
    multidimensional numerical data for computations like differential equation solvers, data 
    analysis, and visualization, with significant reductions in memory usage. zfp is primarily 
    written in C and C++ but also has Python, Fortran, and other bindings.
target_audience: |
    While zfp can be used in a variety of scenarios, zfp is perfect for teams wishing to 
    integrate lossy compression into codes. For example, zfp includes a set of classes that 
    implement storage and manipulation of a multidimensional array data type. zfp arrays support 
    high-speed read and write random access to individual array elements and are a drop-in 
    replacement for std::vector and native C/C++ arrays. zfp arrays provide accessors like proxy 
    pointers, iterators, and views. zfp arrays allow specifying an exact memory footprint or an 
    error tolerance.
# PACKAGING INFORMATION
#   This information is used to connect your product with its E4S and Spack packages, if available.  It is only
#   needed under certain conditions:
#   e4s_product:    (string) Needed if the E4S name for your product is different than your preferred `name` of the product.
#                   If your product is not in E4S, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#   spack_name:     (string) Needed if the Spack package name differs from the `e4s_product` name.
#                   If your product does not have a Spack package, uncomment and set the value to `nil`
#
e4s_product: ZFP
spack_name: zfp
