The goal of this BoF session is to help connect SUNDIALS software developers with users and developers from applications and numerical software projects.  The session will start with an overview of the SUNDIALS suite, emphasizing new features.  The session will continue with brief presentations from SUNDIALS application users, including Steve DeWitt from the MEUMAPPS-SS phase field simulation team at ORNL and Thomas Blommel from a quantum simulation SciDAC project at the University of Michigan.  The goals of this session are:

- Share successes and failures of SUNDIALS uses among applications
- Provide an overview of SUNDIALS for people interested in using the software
- Discuss numerical software collaborations and identify features needed for further SUNDIALS development
