This BOF session will cover post- and _in-situ_ analysis and visualization. The BOF will be focused on updating the community on what is new and upcoming in ParaView, getting information from prominent users, and having a panel-style discussion. Therefore, the BOF will include an introduction and state of things by the ParaView/Catalyst development team, member talks, and a discussion.
