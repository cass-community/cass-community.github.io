# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" seperators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md (all lowercase)
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Please see the accompanying README.md for more detailed information and guidance.
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   area:                   (string) REQUIRED The technical area of the product.  For now, we are using
#                           the areas that were used by ECP ST, except that anything that was categorized as
#                           NNSA Software under ECP should instead be listed under the appropriate "real" area:
#                           Values include: "dataviz", "devtools", "mathlibs", "pmr", "sweco".
#                           We also support the values used in e4s.yml files, though we prefer those above. 
#   cass_member:            (list) REQUIRED The names of the CASS member organizations (aka software stewardship
#                           organizations) you are associated with. Values include: "FASTMath", "PEOS", "RAPIDS", "S4PST", "STEP".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: COLABS, CORSA, SWAS)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A short description of your software.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#                           after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#                           description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#                           sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#                           should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).

description: Software framework for block structured AMR
long_description: |
    AMReX is a C++-based software framework that supports the development of
    structured mesh algorithms for solving systems of partial differential
    equations, with options for adaptive mesh refinement, on machines from
    laptops to exascale architectures. AMReX uses an MPI+X model of
    hierarchical parallelism, in which X can be OpenMP for CPU-only
    machines, or CUDA, HIP or SYCL for NVIDIA, AMD or Intel GPUs,
    respectively. AMReX provides a performance portability layer for kernel
    launching on GPU accelerators. AMReX also provides data structures and
    iterators that enable developers to operate on distributed
    multi-dimensional arrays. Additionally, AMReX provides adaptive mesh
    refinement, memory management, parallel I/O, particles, complex
    geometries, linear solvers, and FFT. AMReX has a Python binding that
    provides GPU-enabled zero-copy data access for AI/ML, in situ analysis,
    application coupling and enables rapid, massively parallel prototyping.
target_audience: |
    AMReX provides a unified software infrastructure with the functionality
    needed for a wide variety of structured grid applications to be able to
    effectively utilize current and future architectures. AMReX is open
    source and has an extensive set of online documentation, consisting of
    both narrative form documentation and an API reference. There are also a
    large number of example codes and associated documentation demonstrating
    how to build applications range from very simple to very complex. The
    power and flexibility of AMReX for enabling scientific advances is best
    illustrated by the range of applications that rely on it to run at the
    scale required by their science drivers. AMReX is being used by applications
    in accelerator modeling, astrophysics, atmosphere and ocean modeling,
    biology, combustion, cosmology, epidemiology, microelectronics,
    micro-fluidics, neutrino quantum kinetics, particle-laden multiphase
    flows, and solid mechanics, among others.

#
# PACKAGING INFORMATION
#   This information is used to connect your product with its E4S and Spack packages, if available.
#   e4s_product:    (string) If your product is in E4S, list its e4S name here (may be different than `name`). If your
#                   product is not in E4S, comment out this entry.
#   spack_name:     (string) The name of your spack package(s), if available.  If you don't have a Spack package, comment out this
#                   entry. If your product has multiple Spack packages, list them using YAML list syntax:
#                   spack_name:
#                       - package1
#                       - package2
#                       - package3
