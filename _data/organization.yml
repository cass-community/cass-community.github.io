# CASS organizational information: members, steering committee, officers

# CASS member organizations
#
# Required fields:
#   short_name: acronym or shorthand name by which the organization is known.  This
#     is the primary key to the list structure
#   name: full name of the organization
#   membership_level: core, affiliate, or former
# Optional fields:
#   website: URL of the organization's website
#   lead: list of organization (co-)leads with institutional affiliation in
#     parenthesis, as in "- name (affiliation)"
#   sc_reps: list of steering committe representatives with institutional 
#     affiliation in parenthesis, as in "- name (affiliation)".  Note that
#     according to the CASS by-laws, core members have only one SC rep, while
#     affiliates may have multiple (one per five affiliate members).
#
#     For affiliates, expect that a list of steering committee members will be
#     the concatenation of the unique sc_reps values from the affiliate member
#     entries.  So you can safely duplicate sc_reps or just have one per every
#     five affiliates.
#   focus_area: A short phrase describing the focus area(a) of the member organization.
#     This needs to be very terse in order not to blow out the formatting of the table
#     where it is displayed.
