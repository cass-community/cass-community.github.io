MPICH is a widely used, open-​source implementation of the MPI message passing standard. MPICH has been ported to many platforms and used by several vendors and research groups as the basis for their own MPI implementations. This BoF session will provide a forum for core MPICH developers to share new features and release plans with the CASS community. We will also invite short presentations from users to share experiences using MPICH to showcase new capabilities such as running at scale, utilizing new MPI features, or experimenting with non-standard MPICH extensions.
