#   description: A short description of your working group.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#   after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#   description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#   sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#   should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.
