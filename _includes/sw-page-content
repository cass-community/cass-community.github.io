CASS member organizations facilitate the stewardship of a broad range of scientific software products, which are used in many different areas of computational science and engineering.  Many of these packages have received support from the U.S. Department of Energy [Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research](https://www.energy.gov/science/ascr/advanced-scientific-computing-research) and the [Software Technologies](https://www.exascaleproject.org/research/#software) focus area of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/). All are freely available under open source licenses.  Many are available as [Spack](https://spack.io/) packages and as part of the [Extreme-Scale Scientific Software Stack](https://e4s.io) (E4S) software distribution which maintains [a portal](https://e4s-project.github.io/DocPortal.html) with additional documentation for member products. Links to the E4S documentation, the Spack packages, and other useful resources are available on the individual product pages.

The current CASS software portfolio focuses on freely available libraries and tools that support leading-edge computational science and engineering research on high-performance parallel computers. Most of the software has been developed with support from the U.S. Department of Energy [Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research](https://www.energy.gov/science/ascr/advanced-scientific-computing-research), and the [Software Technologies](https://www.exascaleproject.org/research/#software) focus area of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/).  Many products have [Spack]({{ "/software/spack.html" | relative_url }}) packages available and are part of the [E4S]({{ "/software/e4s.html" | relative_url }}) distribution to facilitate installation.
