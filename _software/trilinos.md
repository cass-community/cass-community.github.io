# Product information for CASS website product catalog
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
#   This is a Jekyll Markdown file, which starts with YAML "frontmatter." For the product 
#   catalog, we will be using only the YAML frontmatter (between the "---" seperators).  
#   Please leave the main body empty.  
#
#   Please name the file itself for the software product: <name>.md (all lowercase)
#
#   We've tried to require the minimum, but anything optional you choose to add will enrich your
#   product's entry in the catalog.  To provide optional items, please uncomment the keys and complete
#   the value appropriately.
#
#   Please see the accompanying README.md for more detailed information and guidance.
#
# BASIC PRODUCT INFORMATION (ALL REQUIRED)
#   name:                   (string) REQUIRED The name under which your product should appear in the catalog
#   area:                   (string) REQUIRED The technical area of the product.  For now, we are using
#                           the areas that were used by ECP ST, except that anything that was categorized as
#                           NNSA Software under ECP should instead be listed under the appropriate "real" area:
#                           Values include: "dataviz", "devtools", "mathlibs", "pmr", "sweco".
#                           We also support the values used in e4s.yml files, though we prefer those above. 
#   cass_member:            (list) REQUIRED The names of the CASS member organizations (aka software stewardship
#                           organizations) you are associated with. Values include: "FASTMath", "PEOS", "RAPIDS", "S4PST", "STEP".
#                           (other CASS members are not stewarding software products, as far as we know: COLABS, CORSA, SWAS)
#   description:            (string) REQUIRED A short description of your software.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#                           after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#                           description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#                           sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#                           should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.
#   long_description:       (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of your software. A brief, moderately technical description 
#                           of your software's primary features and capabilities.
#   target_audience:        (multiline string) REQUIRED A one-paragraph description of who should be interested in your software.  This should be
#                           less technical than the description -- meant to guide someone who's inexpert or just trying to 
#                           figure out who might be using the software.
#
# Note on multline string entries (long_description and target_audience): YAML supports a multiline string entry that allows 
# a value to be a paragraph (or several).  A multiline string value starts with a pipe ("|") following the colon of the key, with
# the text of the value starting on the following line.  The entirety of the value should be indented by 2-4 spaces from the
# left margin.  The value ends at the next outdented text (or comment).

description: Collection of reusable scientific software libraries
long_description: |
    The Trilinos software suite comprises a collection of reusable scientific libraries,
    providing linear, non-linear, and optimization solvers, as well as discretizations.
    It excels in parallel computing, utilizing sparse linear solvers and a range of
    data structures and functions for parallel linear algebra.
    Trilinos is compatible with major parallel architectures,
    leveraging the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for inter-node parallelism
    and the Kokkos programming model for intra-node parallelism, ensuring that
    its source code can be compiled for diverse computing environments.
    The software is organized into distinct packages, each with its own identity,
    allowing for simultaneous development and recognition within the research community.

target_audience: |
    Trilinos is primarily designed for developers of scientific applications,
    serving as a versatile tool for both research and production environments.

# PACKAGING INFORMATION
#   This information is used to connect your product with its E4S and Spack packages, if available.
#   e4s_product:    (string) If your product is in E4S, list its e4S name here (may be different than `name`). If your
#                   product is not in E4S, comment out this entry.
#   spack_name:     (string) The name of your spack package(s), if available.  If you don't have a Spack package, comment out this
#                   entry. If your product has multiple Spack packages, list them using YAML list syntax:
#                   spack_name:
#                       - package1
#                       - package2
#                       - package3

spack_name: trilinos
