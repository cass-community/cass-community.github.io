Spack is an open-source package manager for scientific computing with a rapidly growing community of over 1,500 contributors. In the past year, Spack has undergone some of the most significant changes in its 12-year history, with the release of v1.0. This BoF will feature an update from developers, covering Spack v1.0’s enhanced compiler dependency model, improved parallelism, and stable package API. We’ll also talk about version 1.1’s uptake by users and our plans for Spack version 1.2.  Spack v1.2 will be the first pip-installable Spack version, will feature improved performance, improved configuration sharing mechanisms, and SBOM support, usability improvements, more parallelism, and improved error messages. We’ll also open the floor for questions. Help us make installing HPC software simple!
