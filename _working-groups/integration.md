#   description: A short description of your working group.  The `description` is always shown immediately 
#   after the `name` and they should be considered together as, in effect constructing a sentence-length 
#   description of the product with the form `name: desciption`.  However it does not need to be a complete 
#   sentence in the grammatical sense.  Key points: The `description` should *not* repeat the `name`, it 
#   should be in sentence case, and it should *not* end with a period.

charter:
  purpose: |
    The CASS Integration Working Group's goal is to enhance the quality, sustainability, efficiency, and interoperability of scientific and AI software. This happens at two levels: (1) ecosystem level – improving how different software products and communities work together (interoperability); and (2) software product level – improving individual libraries and tools within our software portfolios including programming systems, data and visualization, math libraries, tools, and workflows.  Since different product communities have unique needs and development stages, focusing on both the broader ecosystem and specific products is essential for creating a well-integrated software environment.
  relationships: |
    Integration working group efforts are often synergistic with the Impact Framework and User-Developer Experience (UDX) working groups.
