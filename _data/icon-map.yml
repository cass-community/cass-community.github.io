# A "standard" mapping of resource labels to icons to use when displaying them,
# for use throughout the site (but especially in the software catalog)
#
# Multi-word labels should be in SENTENCE case
#
# The icon entry should be an HTML reference to a FontAwesome icon of the
# form `<i class-"fa-something fa-else"></i>`

- label: Website
  icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i>
- label: Repository
  icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>
- label: Downloads
  icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down"></i>
- label: Documentation
  icon: <i class="fa-regular fa-file-lines"></i>
#
# Also use this structure to uniformly lookup icons used
# elsewhere on the site (i.e. not in resource link lists)
#
- label: Area
  icon: <i class="fa-regular fa-folder-open"></i>
- label: CASS member
  icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-hand"></i>
- label: Package links
  icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-box-open"></i>
