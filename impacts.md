We *do* science, and our science enables *other* science (fundamental research).  We want to present some examples where we can talk about the science we're doing (on the computing side), and how it enables advances in fundamental research.  Preferrably examples where we can tie back to multiple software products.  And/or advances on the computing side enabling advances in multiple areas of fundamental research.
