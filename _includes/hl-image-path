  hl-image-path

  Given the name of a highlight image file, return the path
  for use in an {% include figure %} call.  This path still
  needs to go through relative_url, but figure does that
  for us.

  Parameters
    image: base name of image file (REQUIRED)
    dir: directory name for image file (optional, default: site.highlight_image_dir)
{% endcomment -%}
{% assign dir = include.dir | default: site.highlight_image_dir -%}
{{ include.image | prepend: dir -}}
